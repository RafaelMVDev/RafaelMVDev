ABOUT ME
🎂 I'm 16 years old...

🔭 Currently, I'm in the 1st year of the Integrated Technical High School...

🏫 I'm studying at the Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of São Paulo...

🌱 Right now, I'm learning Python, C, HTML, and CSS! ...

📫 How to contact me: rafaelmoralesvillela@gmail.com

👨🏻‍💻 I have basic knowledge of Python, C, and Git!

JOURNEY 🚀
Everything started with Roblox. While playing games on the platform, a question popped into my mind: How are they made?
That question led me to discover Roblox Studio and, consequently, my first contact with a programming language: LUA.



After a few months trying to learn its fundamentals and services, a friend invited me to learn another language: Python! Since then, I've been working to improve my knowledge and practice in this language.

# JOURNEY 🚀  
Everything started with Roblox. While playing games on the platform, a question popped into my mind: How are they made?  
That question led me to discover Roblox Studio and, consequently, my first contact with a programming language: **LUA**.

After a few months trying to learn its fundamentals and services, a friend invited me to learn another language: **Python**! Since then, I've been working to improve my knowledge and practice in this language.
